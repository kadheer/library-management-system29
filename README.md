# Library Management System

## Description
This is a simple library management system implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The system allows members to borrow and return books, while the library tracks the status of books.

## Features
- **Book** class: Stores details about books (title, author, ISBN).
- **Member** class: Represents a library member who can borrow and return books.
- **Library** class: Manages a collection of books and allows members to interact with the system.

- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- Expand the system to handle multiple types of users (admins, librarians, etc.).
